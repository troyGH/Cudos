Cudos is a 3-tier web application hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

The website is currently live for QA purposes, following features are ready:
1. Search for a business using Google Maps & Places API.
2. Display list of employees within a specific business.
3. Display stars & reviews of an existing employee.
4. Submit a review for an existing employee.
5. Login & Signup using Facebook or Email.

Since every instances are on the cloud, it is not nessessary download any software to view the demo. 
Administrator access will be provided for viewing content of our project's architecture.
It is recommended that the grader visit our site before reading the remaining content.

Our full stack development includes a presentation tier, application tier, and database tier.
Presentation tier handles user interfaces and requests. Application tier traverses all data between presentation & database. Database tier handles query statements to manipulate the data.
To present our working full stack, we created 3 seperate AWS server entities to illustrate the job of each tier.
